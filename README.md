# Hospital-ER-Dashboard
This project creates a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize hospital emergency room (ER) data. It includes metrics like patient volumes, referral patterns, and identification scores, using DAX for advanced calculations and data modeling.
The dashboard provides insights into ER patient data, featuring consolidated views, monthly trends, and detailed patient information.

Key Features
Consolidated View: Summary of key metrics.

Monthly View: Trends and patterns over time.

Patient Details: Breakdown by referral status and age group.

DAX Techniques
Calculated Columns: Categorize data (e.g., age groups).

Measures: Calculate KPIs like patient counts.

Filter Context: Use CALCULATE and FILTER for dynamic calculations.

Time Intelligence: Compare data over time with functions like TOTALYTD.

Usage
Import ER data into Power BI.

Apply DAX for data modeling.

Build visualizations (charts, tables).

Add interactivity with slicers and filters.

Future Enhancements
Add predictive analytics.

Implement role-based access.

Optimize for mobile devices.
